Refactor TeiInteract controllers and views to make better semantic sense...

Sneak our modified version of the TeiDisplay stylesheets in as defaults in the TeiDisplay db

Get TEI stuff out of the DB via AJAX whenever someone hovers over a trigger tag
-pass the value of the tage back to the view controller as a param to the db query...

Done------
----------
Get bits of the TEI into the database
-register functions in the XSL so I can udate the db at the end of a file scan...
